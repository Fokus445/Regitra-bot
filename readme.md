# Regitra Driving Exam Scheduling Bot

[!NOTE]
This is the first real problem-solving project I made after learning Python in 2021. It doesn't work anymore.

## Overview

Failing my first driving exam meant a three-month wait for the next one, pushing it well past the prime summer season. Frustrated and determined, I embarked on a coding mission: building a bot to help me snag an exam slot before the summer officially ended.

## Challenge

The biggest hurdle was Google's reCAPTCHA V3 designed to stop bots. After diving into various solutions, I discovered the power of captcha-solving APIs. These services use clever algorithms to decipher captchas, allowing my bot to bypass this challenge.

## Results

Within the first day, the bot found 20 available exam slots! But the competition was fierce. By strategically adjusting the refresh rate again, I managed to secure the 20th slot, granting me a chance to retake the exam the very next day.

## Helping Others

I knew others were facing the same problem. I launched a Facebook page, sharing the story of my bot's creation and its potential. The message spread. The result? Over 10 people were able to schedule their exams before summer slipped away.

One thing remains clear: sometimes, the best summer adventures start with a determined line of code.
